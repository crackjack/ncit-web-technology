<p> <strong> <em> Graphic design </em> </strong> is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, space, image and color.</p>

The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is 
used interchangeably with these due to overlapping skills involved. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine 
words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of 
typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to produce a final result.
                  <p>     <pre>    Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and 
the products (designs) which are generated.</pre>

Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding), publications (magazines, newspapers and books), print 
advertisements, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. For example, a product package
 might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as images, shapes and color which 
unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.
