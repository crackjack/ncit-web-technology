<marquee><h3>Peerless Bolt powers to 200m gold</h3></marquee>
<p>Aug 19, 2016- The incomparable Usain Bolt powered his way around the Rio track to win the Olympic 200 meters gold for the third straight Games in 19.78 seconds on Thursday and remain on course for an extraordinary "triple-triple" of sprint titles.<br>
The Jamaican simply laid waste to the best of the rest in the sprinting world to win his eighth track gold medal in what he has said will be his last individual race at the Olympics before his retirement next year.<br>&quot;I don't need to prove anything else. What else can I do to prove to the world I am the greatest?&quot; Bolt told reporters.<br>

&quot;I am trying to be one of the greatest. Be among (Muhammad) Ali and Pele. I hope to be in that bracket after these Games.&quot;</p>

Andre de Grasse of Canada, who won bronze behind Bolt in the 100 meters, finished second in 20.02 
seconds to claim his second sprint medal of 
the Games and establish himself as the heir apparent to the Sprint King.

Christophe Lemaitre of France secured his first major individual medal by taking bronze, edging out 
Adam Gemili of Britain in a photo finish after they were both awarded the same time of 20.12.

Bolt, who turns 30 on Sunday, will return to the track on Friday with his Jamaican relay team mates 
looking for a 4x100 gold to complete the sweep of all three sprint titles at three successive Olympics.

<h3>AIR GUITAR</h3>

The great showman responded, of course, by playing air guitar and swaying to the music playing through the 
loudspeakers while smiling and nodding straight into the TV camera.

Beaten only once in nine years in his favorite event, the Jamaican had said he thought the world record of 
19.19 he set at the 2009 world 
championships in Berlin 
was within 
reach.

He knew a good 
start would be essential 
if he was to manage that and duly 
got out of the blocks in the fifth fastest time of the eight-man field.

Head down and hands pumping away as he built up speed over the first 30 meters, Bolt rounded the bend with a 
clear lead and eased into his awesome full stride down the home straight.
