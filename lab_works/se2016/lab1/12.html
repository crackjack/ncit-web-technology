<body>This body part will be seen below .it is somehow like the content of the website and this is written without the use of of the tag like h1 h2 etc which are available in html now lets wht wil happen if we use those tag line.
<h1>it helps to increase the size of the font and it can be use full in making the the heading of the web page .There are all together 6 tag line to increase the font </h1>
<h2>previous line is written by using the tag h1 and this line is written by using the h2 and the difference is the size of the font in this line is smaller then the previous one so we can conclude that tag h6 gives the smallest font</h2><h3>if we open these all thing we see all the text in same paragraph no 
matter 
how 
many 
times  we press the enter so yo might be thinking that then how to change the paragraph in html </h3><p>Here I used the another tag line available in html which helps to seprate the the paragraph and the procedure to change the paragraph is that at frist we have to open the tag  called p just like the way we opened the other tag line previously and write the all the information or lets say text or bla bla bla bla  and close the tag p </p>
<p> now we can see that here are two paragraph. the frist  one and second one is written in different tag which can demonstrate the benifts of using those tag .o ho ho  what a empty mind....... right now I  am in confusion what to write  so  i am writting  all these nonsense  hahahahaaha </p>
ok this is all about the the paragaraoh now suppose we need to make to write different statment in different line then what we are suppose to do is just use the other tag  called br like this <br>
 And the frist point is Dr moshoor gulati is my best chracter in TKSS<br>
  o ho ho what a busy day <br>  </body>
